# ChemDes
An integrated web-based platform for molecular descriptor and fingerprint computation.<br>
It is now avaliable at: http://www.scbdd.com/chemdes

## Introduction
 ChemDes is a free web-based platform for the calculation of molecular descriptors and fingerprints, which provides more than 
 `3,679` molecular descriptors that are divided into 61 logical blocks.In addition, it provides `59` types of molecular 
 fingerprint systems for drug molecules, including `topological fingerprints`, `electro-topological state (E-state) fingerprints`,
`MACCS keys`, `FP4 keys`, `atom pairs fingerprints`, `topological torsion fingerprints` and `Morgan/circular fingerprints`, et al.

## Features
* ChemDes is freely available to the public and requires no programming skills.
* ChemDes has integrated various molecular descriptors and fingerprints from the toolkits written in different
programming languages (C++, Python and Java...). 
* ChemDes integrates MOPAC software and incorporates three useful tools (ChemCONV, ChemMOP and ChemFPS).
* ChemDes possesses advantages of cross-platform and interoperability. Users can access this platform via almost all the operation system types (Microsoft windows, Linux, Mac OS, Android)
and client types (PC clients, mobile clients); The calculating results and input/output files from ChemDes can be directly used in other calculations or studies. 

## Functionalities
### Molecular descriptors
ChemDes allows users to compute `3679` molecular descriptors from several open source packages (for details see [Molecular descriptors library](http://www.scbdd.com/chemdes/list-descriptors/)).
* Chemopy Descriptors (`1135`)
* CDK Descriptors (`275`)
* RDKit Descriptors (`196`)
* Pybel Descriptors (`24`)
* BlueDesc Descriptors (`174`)
* PaDEL Descriptors (`1875`)

### Molecular fingerprints
ChemDes allows users to compute 59 types of molecular fingerprints (for details see Molecular fingerprints library).
* Molecular Fingerprints (`59`)

### Useful tools
